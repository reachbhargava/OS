Question: Execute your program from task 2.1 at least 100 times. Is the output of your program always
exactly the same? Which values do the two threads print for my_value? Do you spot a
difference compared to your program from task 1.1? Explain your observations.

Answer: Yes, the output is always the same. All values are 18951, but this is just because of the sleep after thread creation.
Because threads are sharing their global var scope, var gets actually changed for both threads.
