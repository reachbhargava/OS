Load your module from task 1.2 and perform tests with your clock implementation including
the configuration options. What behavior are you expecting and what are you observing?
What happens if you read the clock file multiple times in a loop while concurrently changing
the output formatting option?

Expecting:Every time there is given a new value to the configuration file, the output changes its format.

Observing: as expected

If we're reading the file multiple times and changing the output format concurently the outpput changes when the format is changed.
